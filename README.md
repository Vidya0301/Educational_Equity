# ðŸ“Š Promoting Educational Equity Through Data Driven Insights

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to analyze student performance data and uncover patterns that can help promote **educational equity**. By using data-driven insights, we identify gaps in performance based on gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation, and suggest actionable strategies to improve equity in education.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
**Source:** [Students Performance Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

**Attributes:**
- `gender`
- `race/ethnicity`
- `parental level of education`
- `lunch`
- `test preparation course`
- `math score`
- `reading score`
- `writing score`

---

## ðŸ›  Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Gender-wise score comparison
   - Impact of parental education
   - Effect of test preparation
   - Correlation heatmaps
3. **Machine Learning Model**
   - **Decision Tree Classifier**
   - Predict pass/fail based on background and scores
   - Evaluate with accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Students with **test preparation course** perform significantly better.
- **Parental education level** strongly correlates with higher scores.
- Some **gender-based score gaps** exist in math and writing.
- Lunch type (standard vs. free/reduced) shows performance differences.

## ðŸ¤– Model Performance
- **Algorithm:** Decision Tree Classifier  
- **Accuracy:** ~85%  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
